The PDF document "Project summer 2020"  shows the instructions provided for the project. VHDL code for a 4-bit synchronous pipeline parallel adder was pre-written and supplied by the professor. Changes were made to implement both a 2-pipeline and 6-pipeline parallel adder. Timing analysis and testing is shown in the "FinalProjectReport" PDF. Project was created, modified, and executed using Xilinx Vivado.
The .zip file contains the same files provided as well as the executable project formatted for the 2-bit design.
